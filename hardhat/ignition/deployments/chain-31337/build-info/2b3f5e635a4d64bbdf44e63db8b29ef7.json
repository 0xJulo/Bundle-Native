In\n addition to inheriting this contract, you must define both functions, invoking the\n {Pausable-_pause} and {Pausable-_unpause} internal functions, with appropriate\n access control, e.g. using {AccessControl} or {Ownable}. Not doing so will\n make the contract pause mechanism of the contract unreachable, and thus unusable."
